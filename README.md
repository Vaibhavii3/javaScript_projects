This repository contains several JavaScript projects I have worked on. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates various programming concepts and techniques, such as operators, if-else statements, and switch cases. Below is a brief description of each project along with instructions on how to run them.

The String Manipulation project contains various functions that perform different operations on strings, such as reversing a string, changing case, and Check Palindeome using JavaScript string methods and operators.

## Tip Calculator

### Description
The Tip Calculator is a simple program that calculates the amount of tip to be given based on the total bill amount and the desired tip percentage using JavaScript operators and if-else statements.

## Traffic Light
